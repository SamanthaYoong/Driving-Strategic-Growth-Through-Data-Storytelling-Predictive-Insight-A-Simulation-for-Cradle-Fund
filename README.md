#  Cradle Fund Simulation Case Study: Driving Strategic Growth Through Data Storytelling & Predictive Insight

## ✅ Objective
This project simulates how Cradle Fund could enhance decision-making, funding strategy, and ecosystem growth by leveraging predictive analytics, stakeholder-focused dashboards, and cross-functional data storytelling.

---

## ✅ Business Challenge

Cradle Fund aims to improve the success rate of early-stage startups in Malaysia. However, internal teams lacked predictive visibility into:
- High-potential startups at early stages.
- Sectors delivering highest ROI across funding cycles.
- Operational bottlenecks affecting grant disbursement and application efficiency.

---

## ✅ Approach & Methodology

### 1. Analytics & Insights Generation
- Developed a **predictive scoring model** using logistic regression to estimate startup success likelihood.
- Key input features:
  - Founding team experience
  - Funding utilization rate
  - ARR growth or user metrics
  - Sector maturity index
- Result: Predicted **~18% improvement** in identifying outperformers earlier in the funnel.

---

### 2. Stakeholder Collaboration
- Conducted stakeholder interviews (finance, marketing, operations) to identify key data needs.
- Defined 5 cross-functional KPIs:
  - Fund ROI by sector
  - Startup Health Score
  - Time-to-Funding
  - Application-to-Grant Conversion
  - Founders’ Engagement Index
- Delivered simplified reports for non-technical audiences.

---

### 3. Reporting & Visualization
- Built a **Power BI dashboard** with:
  - Filters by funding cohort, industry, and founder profile
  - Heatmap of underperforming sectors
  - Anomaly alerts for delays in fund disbursement
- Automated a monthly summary report using DAX & Python for time efficiency.

---

### 4. Innovation & Advanced Analytics
- Implemented **K-Means clustering** to group startups by product maturity and traction velocity.
- Integrated **SQL + Python ETL pipelines** to support:
  - Real-time alert system for traction drop-offs
  - Startup segmentation insights
- Proposed integration of lightweight ML models into internal analytics tools.

---

### 5. Research & Ecosystem Insight
- Created a sample insight article:
  > **“Where Are Malaysia’s Hidden Unicorns?”**
  - Benchmarked Cradle-backed startups vs. SEA's top-funded companies
  - Identified predictive indicators to assist internal grant teams
- Proposed an internal content series: **Cradle Insight Briefs** for cross-team learning.

---

## ✅ Simulated Outcomes
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| High-potential startup detection | ↑ 18–22% |
| Reporting turnaround time | ↓ from 2 weeks → 3 days |
| Department alignment on KPIs | Achieved across 3 units |
| Dashboard automation | Reduced manual reporting load |
| Insight content creation | Enabled internal thought leadership |

---

## ✅ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (ETL, data joins, validation)
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn for modeling & clustering)
- **Power BI** (interactive dashboards, DAX)
- **Tableau** (visual prototypes)
- **Excel** (KPI simulation & financial model)
- **Notion** (insight publishing & collaboration)
- **Public Data** (Crunchbase, Dealroom, MyStartupHub)

---

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Predictive Modeling & Segmentation
- KPI Development Across Departments
- Real-time Dashboarding
- ML-Driven Alerts & Pattern Detection
- Data Storytelling for Strategy
- Startup Ecosystem Research

---

## ✅ Use Case
This case study was created to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis, stakeholder collaboration, and business impact simulation for the **Cradle Fund Data Analyst** role. It blends advanced analytics with strategic storytelling to support public sector innovation and startup ecosystem growth.
